# Introduction

The contribution of this paper comprise:

-   conceptualisation of sequencing separation for arrival management and development of an open data and open software based implementation of the approach; and

-   use-case application of the developed approach on a subset of airports within the European <!-- and international context -->

# Trajectory-Based Operations - Arrival Management

## header 2

some cool text.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

# Data and Conceptual Approach

## Approach

data preparation

-   trajectory data - Opensky Network, weekly downloads
-   airport information - Openstreet Map

data downloaded & script development, data cleaning

### Trajectory Flight Phase Segmentation & Milestone

Different approaches exists to detect and describe aircraft flight phases, e.g. recent machine learning algorithm [@sun2017flightphase].
This paper implements a heuristic approach with a focus on the detection of arrival traffic at the study airports.

### Landing Runway Identification

The identification of the landing direction is based on a simple geospatial heuristic.
Conceptually, aircraft are aligned with the runway (centerline) before landing.
An aircraft is assigned to a landing runway based on the closeness of its pre-landing positions to the extended runway centerline.

## Open Data for Operational Performance Monitoring

## Arrival Sequencing

sequence separation

# Case Study - Results

## Data Sampling

At the time of writing no global open flight table exists.
For this study, we validated the sample with reference data available to the Performance Review Unit.
Under the EUROCONTROL Performance Review System, airport operators report movement data on a monthly basis [@apdf_v1_2019].

# Conclusions
